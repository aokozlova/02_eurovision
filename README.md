# Eurovision Song Contest Analysis
This project aims to analyze Eurovision Song Contest data through web scraping, visualization, and machine learning. The ESC_scraping.py file contains the Python script for scraping data from the official Eurovision Song Contest website.

The next steps will include data visualization using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, followed by data analysis and prediction using machine learning algorithms.
